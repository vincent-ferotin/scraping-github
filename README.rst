Demo of scraping `GitHub`'s page to illustrate "depth-first" order of `Scrapy`
==============================================================================

This repository contains a `Scrapy <http://scrapy.org/>`_ project scraping
first pages of three `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_\ 's projects,
and some figures of its results.
It aims to demonstrate that `Scrapy` so-called `"depth-first" order
<http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/faq.html#does-scrapy-crawl-in-breadth-first-or-depth-first-order>`_
is actually a **breadth-first order**.

`Scrapy` project crawls some :ref:`given and specified web structure <structure>`,
and outputs both requests and responses proceeded orders,
allowing to reconstruct walked graph.

Actually crawling orders for both requests and responses are stored (by hand)
in graphs in ``tree/`` directory (files created with `Inkscape
<http://www.inkscape.org/>`_\ ). They exist for :ref:`two configurations
<configurations>` of `Scrapy`,
default one (files named ``github-tree-*-depth_priority_0``) described
as configuration for "depth-first" order, and alternative configuration
(files named ``github-tree-*-depth_priority_1``) for "breadth-first" order.


.. _structure:

Scraped structure
-----------------

Project crawls three `GitHub`\ 's projects (``scrapy/scrapy``, ``scrapy/scrapyd``,
``scrapinghub/scrapylib``) and in each project crawls two or three directories,
then in each of these directories one, two or three files.

Complete crawled structure follows,
and is defined in project as :data:`github.spiders.PROJECTS`\ ::

    github.com
     \_ github's search page
         \_ scrapy/scrapy
             \_ docs/
                 \_ README,
                 \_ conf.py
                 \_ faq.rst
             \_ scrapy/
                 \_ VERSION
                 \_ spider.py
             \_ extras
                 \_ scrapy.1
                 \_ scrapy_zsh_completion
         \_ scrapy/scrapyd
             \_ docs/
                 \_ conf.py
                 \_ index.rst
                 \_ install.rst
             \_ scrapyd/
                 \_ VERSION
                 \_ app.py
                 \_ utils.py
             \_ extras
                 \_ test-scrapyd.sh
         \_ scrapinghub/scrapylib
             \_ scrapylib/
                 \_ redisqueue.py
                 \_ links.py
             \_ tests/
                 \_ test_links.py
                 \_ test_magicfields.py

For each parent node, its direct children order is specified above as top-bottom,
e.g. crawler at ``scrapy/scrapy`` project and ``docs/`` directory will request
``README`` first, then ``conf.py`` and finally ``faq.rst``.
This order is represented in figures ``tree/github-tree*`` as left-to-right.


.. _configurations:

Configurations
--------------

Configuration of project is done through ``github/settings.py``.
Default configuration, as documented by Scrapy here:
http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/faq.html#does-scrapy-crawl-in-breadth-first-or-depth-first-order ,
is for "depth-first" order.

To switch to "breadth-first" order, uncomment last lines as such::

    DEPTH_PRIORITY = 1
    SCHEDULER_DISK_QUEUE = 'scrapy.squeues.PickleFifoDiskQueue'
    SCHEDULER_MEMORY_QUEUE = 'scrapy.squeues.FifoMemoryQueue'

To ensure that requests are proceed without any randomized delay, in the order
they are emitted by spider functions, :data:`RANDOMIZE_DOWNLOAD_DELAY` is set to
``False``.


Collecting requests and responses
---------------------------------

In parsing function, requests emitted and responses received are stored
in spider's :attr:`GitHubSpider.requests` and
:attr:`GitHubSpider.responses` lists.

Requests are stored just before being emitted by parsing function:

.. code-block:: python

    def parse_directory(self, response):
        #...
        for filename in project.dirs[crawled_infos.current_dir]:
            #...
            request = Request(...)
            self.requests.append(request)
            yield request

Responses are stored at parsing function beginning, with:

.. code-block:: python

    def parse_directory(self, response):
        self.responses.append(response)
        #...
